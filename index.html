      <p>The content can't be anymore related! I definitely recognize many of the tags used in the content. I think it's interesting how often div is used. I'm still trying to fully wrap my brain around when to use div vs other tags, and this helps provide some context. I think the HTML used in the website is good. As I dragged the cursor around the various elements, it was easy for me too see how the page was sectioned. Based off of that, I could easily move around in the source code and recognize which sections held which types of elements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please don't judge with the background! I didn't feel a background in any elements would fit in with the design of the website, so I'ved used this area to display that I know how to include a background image to an element :)</p>
