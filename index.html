      <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.com/">This is the official website for Liverpool Football Club.</a>
      <p>The content can't be anymore related! I definitely recognize many of the tags used in the content. I think it's interesting how often div is used. I'm still trying to fully wrap my brain around when to use div vs other tags, and this helps provide some context. I think the HTML used in the website is good. As I dragged the cursor around the various elements, it was easy for me too see how the page was sectioned. Based off of that, I could easily move around in the source code and recognize which sections held which types of elements.</p>
